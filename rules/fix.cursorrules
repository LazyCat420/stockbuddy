- Search General stock market news 
- Scrape the news articles 
- Save the news articles to the Mongo database and Chroma database under a seperate news folder. 
- Summarize the news articles and extract stock tickers from the news articles with ollama tool calling. 
- use yfinance to make sure its valid tickers and save the tickers to the Mongo database and Chroma database under a seperate watchlist folder. 
- Save the summary to the Mongo database and Chroma database under a seperate summary folder. 
- repeat until all the news articles are summarized then summarize all the summaries with ollama to a final summary.
- Go thru each ticker in the watchlist based on the flow we build for the @single_stock_mode.py file. 
- Save the trades with summaries of the trading data to the Mongo database and Chroma database under a seperate trades folder. 

 I want it so When I run General @general_mode.py  pulls tickers and sectors, then we run Sector Analysis with @sector_mode.py  and it pulls more tickers to send to the watchlist in the database, then finally we run Single Stock Analysis on all the tickers in the watchlist using the @single_stock_mode.py. 

2. When asking questions to search thru searxng make sure the question is formatted like a search query rather than a question. for example if you ask "What is the impacts of the fear and greed index to traffs" have the llm shorten and format it into a search query such as "fear and greed index assiciation to tarrifs". That way it uses less words to get to the answer and will have a higher chance of getting unique results.
